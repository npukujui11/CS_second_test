### Please introduce your family?（请介绍你的家庭？）
### Why did you apply for our university?（为什么选择我们学校？）
First of all, I have a relatively deep feeling for NWPU. And if I can back here, it's like going home because I am very familiar with the atmophere and environment of learning, and even which windows in the canteen have delicious food. I also have a lot of familiar classmates and friends here. At second, actually, I'm satisfied with the ability to teach and research after four years of study, especially, the CS of NWPU ranks among the top majors.
For the above reasons, I applied for NWPU for graduate students.Thank you!
首先，我对学校有比较深厚的感情。如果能够回到这里，那么就像回到家一样。因为我对我们学校的学习氛围，学习环境都很熟悉，甚至食堂的哪一个窗口有好吃的食物。在学校里，我还有很多熟悉的同学和朋友。第二，因为经过本科四年的学习，我对学校的教学和科研能力充分认可，尤其是计算机学院，它在全国专业排名居于前列。
基于上述原因，所以我研究生报考了西北工业大学。

### What's your impression of Xi'an?（对西安这个城市有什么印象？）
I think Xi'an is a city with a very strong historical and cultural atmosphere, and you can feel this in every corner of the city. And Xi'an has a long history and many places of interest, such as the City Wall, Dayan Pagoda and Terra-cotta Warriors. Meanwhile, what impressed me was that there are many interesting place names, such as Sajinqiao and Wuweishizi. What's more, I like the weather in Xi'an, it rains less in winter than south, and there is indoor heating.
我认为西安是一个历史人文气息十分浓厚的城市，几乎走在这个城市的任何一个角落都能感受到这一点。西安有着悠久的文化和众多名胜古迹，比如西安城墙、大雁塔、兵马俑等。同时，西安的许多地名非常有意思，比如说洒金桥和五味什字。此外，我喜欢西安的天气，它冬天下雨比南方少，而且还有室内暖气。

### What's your favorite book? (最喜欢的书是什么？)
My favorite book is Beyond Feelings: A Guide to Critical Thinking. This book systematically answers the question of how to get the ability of critical thinking. In our work, study and life, emotions and intuition may often prevent us from understanding the nature of things, and it causes that we can not make rational decisions. Actually, most of us only want to believe in what we want to believe. Nowadays, learning to use critical thinking can make us better understand the world and ourselves.
我最喜欢的书是《超越感觉：批判性思考指南》。这本书系统的回答了一个问题，如何才能掌握批判性思维的能力。在我们的工作、学习和生活中，情绪和直觉可能往往会阻碍我们认识事物的本质，从而不能做出合理决策。很多时候，我们只愿意相信我们愿意相信的事物。现如今，学会使用批判性思维能够让我们更好的了解世界和自己。

### Why should take an examination of graduate student? （为什么要考研？）
About why should I resign my job to pursue postgraduate? I always felt like I was an idealist, so there are many things that I ofter want to do my best. In my work, I was exposed to many new knowledge, and I also felt the lack of knowledge. Therefore, I am eager to improve myself, for example, to be postgraduate can improve my academic and scientific research level and the ability to find problems. On the other hand, at present, there is a certain salary gap between undergraduate and graduate students in many corporations.
关于我为什么要辞去工作选择读研？我一直觉得我是一个理想主义者，许多事情我往往想要做到最好，在我的工作中我接触到了许多全新的内容，而我也在工作中感受到了我的知识面的匮乏，因此我迫切的想要提升自己，比如提高自己的学术科研水平、发现问题和解决问题的能力。另一方面，现阶段，本科和研究生的薪资存在很大的差距。
