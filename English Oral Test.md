### Please introduce your family?（请介绍你的家庭？）
In my family, thera three members, my father, my mother, and I. My father is a lorry driver, and my mother is worker in the factory. They often work very late. I think my family is harmonious and very warm, and my parents are both kind and hard-working. They always teach me how to be independent and persistent. When I make a success, they are more excited than me, and support me to do better. Even though I failed, instead of blaming, they always bear with sorrow with me, and encourage me not to give up easily. During my preparation for postgraduate entrance examination, the support from my family is always my momentum. My parent's love is unselfish, so I will do all what I can to repay them in the future.
在我的家庭中，有三名成员，我的父母以及我。我的父亲是一名货车司机，我的母亲是一名工厂的工人。他们常常工作到很晚。我认为我的家庭是和谐，非常温暖的。我的父母善良而且勤劳。他们总是教我如何独立和坚持。当我成功的时候，他们比我更加兴奋，并支持我做得更好。即使我失败了，他们也不会责怪，而是和我一起默默承受，并且鼓励我不要轻易放弃。在我准备研究生入学考试期间，我的家人的支持是我的动力。我父母的爱是无私的，所将来我会尽我所能来回报他们。

### Please introduce your hometown?（请介绍你的家乡？）
I come from Liuzhou, which a famous industrial city located in the northeast of Guangxi province. Liuzhou is the second largest city in Guangxi, and it has complete production system of the automobile industry. What's more, Liuzhou and Guilin have more than 80% of 4A-level scenic spots in Guangxi. And Liuzhou has some famous fine food, such as Liuzhou snail noodle.
Liuzhou is still closely connected with the NWPU. Rongshui is located in the middle of Liuzhou. Although it is thousands of miles away from Xi'an, it has forged deep friendship in the battle of poverty alleviation.
我来自柳州，一个位于广西东北部的著名城市。柳州是广西第二大城市，其拥有完整的汽车工业生产体系。柳州和桂林拥有广西80%以上的4A级风景区。同时，柳州还有著名的美食，柳州螺蛳粉。我的家乡和西工大还有着千丝万缕的联系，融水，位于柳州的北部，虽然和西安相距千里，但是却在脱贫攻坚战中结下了深厚的友情。

### Why did you apply for our university?（为什么选择我们学校？）
First of all, I have a relatively deep feeling for NWPU. And if I can back here, it's like going home because I am very familiar with the atmophere and environment of learning, and even which windows in the canteen have delicious food. I also have a lot of familiar classmates and friends here. At second, actually, I'm satisfied with the ability to teach and research after four years of study, especially, the CS of NWPU ranks among the top majors.
For the above reasons, I applied for NWPU for graduate students.Thank you!
首先，我对学校有比较深厚的感情。如果能够回到这里，那么就像回到家一样。因为我对我们学校的学习氛围，学习环境都很熟悉，甚至食堂的哪一个窗口有好吃的食物。在学校里，我还有很多熟悉的同学和朋友。第二，因为经过本科四年的学习，我对学校的教学和科研能力充分认可，尤其是计算机学院，它在全国专业排名居于前列。
基于上述原因，所以我研究生报考了西北工业大学。

### What's your impression of Xi'an?（对西安这个城市有什么印象？）
I think Xi'an is a city with a very strong historical and cultural atmosphere, and you can feel this in every corner of the city. And Xi'an has a long history and many places of interest, such as the City Wall, Dayan Pagoda and Terra-cotta Warriors. Meanwhile, what impressed me was that there are many interesting place names, such as Sajinqiao and Wuweishizi. What's more, I like the weather in Xi'an, it rains less in winter than south, and there is indoor heating.
我认为西安是一个历史人文气息十分浓厚的城市，几乎走在这个城市的任何一个角落都能感受到这一点。西安有着悠久的文化和众多名胜古迹，比如西安城墙、大雁塔、兵马俑等。同时，西安的许多地名非常有意思，比如说洒金桥和五味什字。此外，我喜欢西安的天气，它冬天下雨比南方少，而且还有室内暖气。

### What's your favorite book? (最喜欢的书是什么？)
My favorite book is Beyond Feelings: A Guide to Critical Thinking. This book systematically answers the question of how to get the ability of critical thinking. In our work, study and life, emotions and intuition may often prevent us from understanding the nature of things, and it causes that we can not make rational decisions. Actually, most of us only want to believe in what we want to believe. Nowadays, learning to use critical thinking can make us better understand the world and ourselves.
我最喜欢的书是《超越感觉：批判性思考指南》。这本书系统的回答了一个问题，如何才能掌握批判性思维的能力。在我们的工作、学习和生活中，情绪和直觉可能往往会阻碍我们认识事物的本质，从而不能做出合理决策。很多时候，我们只愿意相信我们愿意相信的事物。现如今，学会使用批判性思维能够让我们更好的了解世界和自己。

### Why should take an examination of graduate student? （为什么要考研？）
About why should I resign my job to pursue postgraduate? I always felt like I was an idealist, so there are many things that I often want to do my best. In my work, I was exposed to many new knowledge, and I also felt the lack of knowledge. Therefore, I am eager to improve myself, for example, to be postgraduate can improve my academic and scientific research level and the ability to find problems. On the other hand, at present, there is a certain salary gap between undergraduate and graduate students in many corporations.
关于我为什么要辞去工作选择读研？我一直觉得我是一个理想主义者，许多事情我往往想要做到最好，在我的工作中我接触到了许多全新的内容，而我也在工作中感受到了我的知识面的匮乏，因此我迫切的想要提升自己，比如提高自己的学术科研水平、发现问题和解决问题的能力。另一方面，现阶段，本科和研究生的薪资存在很大的差距。

### How do you prepare your own second test? （你如何准备自己的复试？）
I prepared my second test/interview in two main ways. On the one hand, I focus on learning professional knowledge and improving my professional skills. On the other hand, I focus on collecting the information, such as the minmum passing score and some tutor's research directions. Actually, I think there are two points to the success of the postgraduate entrance examination. It's whether I have enough information, and the other is the ability to analyze the information we got.
我主要从两个方面来准备我的复试，一方面是着重于学习专业知识，提高自身专业技能水平。另一方面是着重于各类信息的搜索。事实上，我认为考研能否成功，有两个关键点，一是我们是否掌握了足够多的信息，二是我们对已经掌握了的信息的分析能力。

### What are your interests? （你的兴趣爱好是什么？）
From my personal aspect, I like sports very much after my work and study, such as soccer and table tennis. And I also joined our university's soccer team while in NWPU. At the same time, I am also a registered soccer referee.

Good morning, professors. I think it's my honor to have this opportunity for this interview. My name is GuRui, 24 years old. I come from LiuZhou, which a famous automobile industrial city located in Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University in July 2019, majoring in Internet of Things. I am a software development engineer at SAIC-General Motors and Wuling after graduation.
In my work, I was exposed to many new knowledge, and I think I am lack of knowledge and educational background. Actually, you know that, at present, there is a certain salary gap between undergraduate and graduate students in many corporations. So I want to be postgraduate to improve my academic and scientific resarch level. 

### Could you talk about the plan for graduate students?（对自己的研究生生涯有何打算？）
First of all, I will systematically read more professional computer books to improve the knowledge structure. And I will spend more time on reading A-level journal in the field of computer to expand my horizon and vision.
Secondly, in my study and work, I increasingly realize the importance of English ability, so I will pay more attention to it, such as CET-6 and TOEFL.
Finally, in the field of scientific research, I will read more literature, actively participate in the tutor’s project, and strive to put forward some constructive suggestions and publish articles in core journals.
首先，我会系统的阅读计算机专业性书籍，完善知识结构。定期阅览计算机领域A类期刊，拓展个人的知识面和视野。
其次，在学习和工作中，我愈发认识到英语能力的重要性，因此研究生阶段我会更加注重英语能力的提升，比如英语六级和托福。
最后，在科研领域，我会多阅读文献，积极参与导师课题，争取能够提出措施，最好能够在核心期刊发表文章。

### Why you choose this research direction?（为什么选择这个研究方向？）
In my undergraduate state, I once took a course, called Data Mining, which involved many methods of processing data. In this course, I found that I had a strong interesting in artificial intelligence.
In my opinion, I think, with the advent of the digital age, the number, types of data are increasing, and AI technology can extract more useful information from these data. At the same time, I think AI will effectively improve productivity and people's lives in the future.
However, there are still many problems that need to be solved, for example, AI algorithms is too complex to be friendly to the average user, and it causes that a lot of computing resources are consumed. And the method has shortcomings of lower understandability in some field, such as automatic drive.

### What is the Operating System?（什么是操作系统？）
Operating system is a software, which used to control and manage the hardware and software resources of the computer system, and rationally organize and schedule the computer work and resocurce allocation to provide other users and software the convenient interface and environment.
